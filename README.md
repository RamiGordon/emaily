# Emaily

This app was build based on the Udemy course [Node with React: Fullstack Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/)

The deployment process is served by heroku. Here you can inspect the production site: https://mighty-tundra-89254.herokuapp.com/

## Considerations

As you can see, right now the app looks... nice.

This course is mainly to understand how React and Express server work together, so the UI is not the priority.
